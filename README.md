# musicApp

- A simple project involving JavaScript, HTML, CSS, paper.js, and howler.js
- Whenever the user press a letter on their keyboard, a sound is played and an animated square is created.
- If you want to change the sound bindings, then change the keyData variable in music.html
- Make some sick beatz!
